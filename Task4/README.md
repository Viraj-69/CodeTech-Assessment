# Sentiment Analysis Task 4 - NLP Project

This project performs sentiment analysis on tweet data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning.

## 📁 Files Included
- `Sentiment_Analysis_Task4.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing full project workflow
- `README.md` - Project overview and instructions

## 🔍 Overview
- **Dataset**: Twitter Sentiment Analysis dataset from GitHub
- **Goal**: Classify tweets into positive or negative sentiment
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Text preprocessing (cleaning, stemming)
  - TF-IDF vectorization
  - Logistic Regression classifier

## 📊 Steps Performed
1. Data Cleaning
2. Text Preprocessing
3. Feature Extraction (TF-IDF)
4. Model Training (Logistic Regression)
5. Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)
6. Insights & Conclusions

## 🧪 Model Accuracy
Achieved approximately **75–80%** accuracy on validation data using basic logistic regression.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab
2. Run each cell sequentially
3. No external CSV upload required — dataset loads from a GitHub URL

## ✅ Future Improvements
- Use deep learning models like LSTM or BERT
- Include emojis/sarcasm handling
- Multi-class sentiment classification (e.g., neutral)
