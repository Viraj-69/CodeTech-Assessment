# CodTech Task-2: Predictive Analysis using Machine Learning

## Objective
Build and evaluate a machine learning model using classification techniques on structured data.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas

## Files Included
- `predictive_analysis.py` – Python script that performs data loading, model training, and evaluation
- `model_evaluation.txt` – Contains classification accuracy and detailed metrics

## Dataset
- Uses `load_breast_cancer` dataset from `sklearn.datasets`
- Suitable for binary classification tasks

## Features
- Feature extraction and preprocessing
- Train-test split (80/20)
- Model: Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluation: Accuracy and Classification Report

## How to Run
```bash
python predictive_analysis.py
```

## Output
- Accuracy printed in terminal
- Detailed report saved in `model_evaluation.txt`
